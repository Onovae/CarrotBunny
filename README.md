# CarrotBunny is a Python project in Investigating a Dataset Using Numpy and Pandas Libraries, vizualizing the data using Matpoltlib.
The dataset TMDb Movies data used in these analysis are details showing 10,000 films collected from TMDb Movie Database. Budget, revenue, released year and some others are some basic data for the analysis.

Below are information supplied by each released film:

8.Production company

9.Budget

10.Revenue

11.Rating/vote.

Below shows the step by step processes that was followed in achieving this project.
